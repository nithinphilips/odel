{"name":"Odel","tagline":"Tool to upload documents to Tririga from command-line","body":"Odel\r\n====\r\nOdel uploads Data Integrator files to Tririga from the command-line. You can\r\nimport the files quickly and easily with Odel. It can also be called from\r\nscript as part of a batch process.\r\n\r\nAn installer is available for Windows. Download it from the [Releases](https://github.com/nithinphilips/odel/releases) section.  Once installed,\r\nyou will have the ``odel`` command available in your Command Prompt.\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n---------------\r\nIf you have Python installed, download the source and install Odel and its\r\ndependencies::\r\n\r\n    python setup.py install\r\n\r\nOnce installed, odel can be invoked using the ``odel`` command::\r\n\r\n    odel --help\r\n\r\nWe will be working with a file called ``users.txt`` (the fields are TAB delimited)::\r\n\r\n    $ cat users.txt\r\n    triFirstNameTX  triLastNameTX   triUserNameTX\r\n    Homer   Simpson hsimpson\r\n    Bender  Rodriguez       brodriguez\r\n\r\nTo upload ``users.txt`` to Tririga running on ``localhost``, you can run::\r\n\r\n    odel --username=system --password=admin --module=triPeople \\\r\n         --businessobject=triPeople --form=triEmployee \\\r\n         http://localhost:9080/ users.txt\r\n\r\nYou can save some typing if you name you DI files to include the module,\r\nbusiness object and form names. For example, if you rename ``users.txt``\r\nto ``triPeople-triPeople-triEmployee.txt``, you can run::\r\n\r\n    odel --username=system --password=admin \\\r\n         http://localhost:9080/ triPeople-triPeople-triEmployee.txt\r\n\r\nOdel will parse the file name to get the type information. See `File Naming\r\nConventions`_ below for more details.\r\n\r\nThe url portion may be shortened to just the server name::\r\n\r\n    odel --username=system --password=admin \\\r\n         localhost:9080 triPeople-triPeople-triEmployee.txt\r\n\r\nThe port can be removed as well. 9080 will be used as the deafult. See `URL\r\nNaming Conventions`_ below for more.\r\n\r\nThe username and password default to ``system`` and ``admin``, so those can\r\nalso be omitted (also now is a good time to change that password!)::\r\n\r\n    odel localhost triPeople-triPeople-triEmployee.txt\r\n\r\nFile Naming Conventions\r\n-----------------------\r\nIf you name your DI files appropriately, Odel can detect the type information\r\nrequired to upload the file to TRIRIGA. It is also a good practice to name your\r\nDI files consistently.\r\n\r\nOdel parses the file name like this:\r\n\r\n1) Split the filename into parts, where each part is separated by a \"-\"\r\n2) Take the last three parts, assume they are Module, Business Object and Form\r\n   names, in that order.\r\n\r\nSo, you can have additional information in the file name, as long as the information\r\nOdel is looking for is at the very end.\r\n\r\nThese are examples of files names for Employee Data. Odel parses all these as\r\nModule = triPeople, Business Object = triPeople, Form = triEmployee\r\n\r\nSimple:\r\n ``triPeople-triPeople-triEmployee.txt``\r\nWith spaces around the ``-``:\r\n ``triPeople - triPeople - triEmployee.txt``\r\nWith a prefix:\r\n ``IterationA - triPeople-triPeople-triEmployee.txt``\r\nWith two prefixes:\r\n ``001 - IterationA - triPeople-triPeople-triEmployee.txt``\r\n\r\nIf the regular parsing of three part file name fails, Odel will try a keyword\r\nsearch to guess the type of the file. Only a single keyword is currently\r\nsearched. Keyword search is NOT case sensitive.\r\n\r\nPatch Helpers:\r\n Searched for the word ``patchhelper``. For example,\r\n ``PatchHelper_UpgradeApplication.txt`` will parse to Module = triHelper,\r\n Business Object = triPatchHelper, Form = triPatchHelper.\r\n\r\nTririga has a limitation of 50 characters for all Data Integrator file names.\r\nIf the file name has more than 50 characters, Odel will truncate the file name\r\nto fit the limits.\r\n\r\nURL Naming Conventions\r\n----------------------\r\nOdel is fairly flexible in handling URL values. Here's what you can enter:\r\n\r\nScheme, host and port:\r\n ``http://tririga.example.com:9080/``\r\nHost and port:\r\n ``tririga.example.com:9080``. This resolves to\r\n ``http://tririga.example.com:9080/``\r\nHost only:\r\n ``tririga.example.com``. This resolves to \r\n ``http://tririga.example.com:9080/``.\r\n\r\nOdel uses port 9080 as the default. This is the default WebSphere application\r\nvirtual host port.\r\n\r\nThere are two special cases. If you enter ``tririga.example.com:443``, it\r\nresolves to ``https://tririga.example.com/``. Note the HTTPS scheme. If you\r\nenter ``tririga.example.com:80``, Odel resolves this to\r\n``http://tririga.example.com/``. This is plain HTTP and the port is omitted.\r\n\r\nWaiting for Processing\r\n----------------------\r\nNormally Odel will terminate as soon as the file is transmitted to Tririga.  It\r\nwill take Tririga a few minutes to process the file and create the records.\r\nOften, when running as part of a batch process you will want to wait until the\r\nfile is processed before performing the next task.\r\n\r\nIf the ``-w`` flag is set, Odel will wait until Tririga changes the data upload\r\nstatus to *Rollup All Completed* or *Failed*, indicating the completion of the\r\nupload process.\r\n\r\nThis only waits for creation of records. Tririga may still continue to process\r\n*Associate* and other asynchronous tasks in the background.\r\n\r\nBuilding Windows Installer\r\n--------------------------\r\nWindows installer can be built on Windows machines. You will need Python 2.7 (Windows version)\r\nand the ``pyinstaller`` package (version 2.0).\r\n\r\n\r\n1. From the project root run::\r\n\r\n    make\r\n\r\n   This will build the binaries.\r\n\r\n2. Change directory to the ``windows`` folder and run make again::\r\n\r\n    cd windows/\r\n    make\r\n\r\n   This will build the ``.msi`` installer.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n    Odel.
